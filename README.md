# Assignment3: Using Numpy, PyTorch and Tensorflow to build Neural Network

- Part(a) : Using Pure numpy to build a neural network.
  - Generated random data using numpy.
  - Initialized weights and bias.
  - Generated output value using input, weights and bias.
  - Implemented class for Relu activation function, mean squred error and linear layers.
  - Trained a linear model and calculated loss

- Part(b) : Using PyTorch to build a neural network
  - Part(a): 
    - Generated random data and onverted it to pytorch tensors.
    - Trained a non linear function using Relu activation 
    - Fit the linear model and vidulaized the data
  - Part(b): Used auto differentiation in PyTorch
    - Using SGD optimizer 
  - Part(c): Used the Module class in PyTorch to train the neural net.
    - Used the torch.nn library to referene the Module class.
    - Created three linear layers and added Relu to them.

- Part(c): Using Tensorflow capabilities for building neural networks 
  - Part(a): 
    - Generate data using Tensorflow and build network without model subclassing and autodifferentiation
  - Part(b):
    - On the generated train by applying autodifferentiation.
    - Used SGD for the optimizer 
  - Part(c: 
    - Added a Dropout layer for model subclassing
